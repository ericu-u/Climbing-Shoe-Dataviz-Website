# Climbing-Shoe-Dataviz-Website
 
Companion project to the REI Climbing Shoes Web-scraping project by Eric Wang.

This project was inspired based on a prompt from my DSC 106: Intro to Data Visualizations class at UCSD, taught by Professor Thomas Powell. Climbing shoes are one of the most important pieces of gear that make strong rock climbing possible. Some of my mentors in the field of climbing directed me to the REI Inc. climbing shoes section to try on shoes and get a feel for what felt best. Because of their extensive shoe catalog, I decided to begin my data viz website project with webscraped data from the REI climbing shoes catalog, but I plan to expand to more shoe sources in the future.

# Climbing-Shoe-Dataviz-Website
 
Companion project to the REI Climbing Shoes Web-scraping project by Eric Wang.

This project was inspired based on a prompt from my DSC 106: Intro to Data Visualizations class at UCSD, taught by Professor Thomas Powell. Climbing shoes are one of the most important pieces of gear that make strong rock climbing possible. Some of my mentors in the field of climbing directed me to the REI Inc. climbing shoes section to try on shoes and get a feel for what felt best. Because of their extensive shoe catalog, I decided to begin my data viz website project with webscraped data from the REI climbing shoes catalog, but I plan to expand to more shoe sources in the future.

## Website Content

When first loading the website, you are greeted with some information regarding the sub-categories of climbing and the different categories of shoes. There are three buttons, each one representing a type of climbing. When hovering over these buttons, additional information and an example image pops up that gives you more detailed information of the activities themselves.

After selecting category buttons, a sunburst chart (created using Highcharts) appears that provides a breakdown on the quantity of types of shoes within each activity. Hovering over the sunburst chart's categories will provide the exact quantity as well.

Clicking the "Next" button or scrolling down will bring you to a scatter plot (created using Highcharts) with an x-axis of price and a y-axis of average rating. Hovering over each point will tell you the name of the shoe, the exact price, and the exact average rating. Clicking on a point will generate a bar plot (created using Highcharts) that illustrate the distribution of ratings. It will also generate the shoe's features in bullet point format.
